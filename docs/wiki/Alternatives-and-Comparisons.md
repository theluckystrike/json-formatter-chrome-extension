## Detailed Comparisons

### JSON Viewer

JSON Viewer is one of the most popular JSON extensions on the Chrome Web Store. It automatically detects JSON pages and renders them as a collapsible tree with syntax highlighting. Its strength is simplicity -- it focuses on page-level JSON rendering and does it well. However, it does not include a built-in editor, does not offer validation with error details, and is not built on Manifest V3. JSON Formatter offers a more complete toolset with an editor, minification, context menu integration, and theme support, while also being open source.

### JSON Editor Online

JSON Editor Online is a powerful web-based JSON editor that also offers a Chrome extension. It provides a rich editing experience with tree view, code view, and a text editor. It supports JSON Schema validation and has a professional feel. On the other hand, it uses a freemium model where some features require a paid plan, and it is not open source. It also does not auto-detect JSON on web pages. JSON Editor Online is a strong choice if you need advanced editing features and do not mind the freemium model. JSON Formatter is better if you want a free, open source, privacy-focused tool that auto-detects JSON pages.

### JSON Handle

JSON Handle is a lightweight extension that focuses on formatting JSON responses in the browser. It auto-detects JSON pages and provides a collapsible tree view. It runs on Manifest V3, which is a plus for security and performance. However, it does not include an editor, lacks detailed validation, and has limited syntax highlighting compared to dedicated JSON tools. JSON Formatter provides a more feature-rich experience with its popup editor, context menu, themes, and file download capability.

### JSONView

JSONView is one of the oldest JSON formatting extensions for browsers, originally created for Firefox and later ported to Chrome. It renders JSON pages with syntax highlighting and collapsible sections. It is open source, which is a significant advantage. However, it has not been updated to Manifest V3, does not include an editor or popup interface, and lacks features like minification, key sorting, and multi-language support. JSON Formatter builds on the same philosophy of open source simplicity while offering a more modern and complete feature set.

## When to Choose JSON Formatter

JSON Formatter is a good fit if you value:

- **Open source transparency** -- you can read and audit every line of code
- **Privacy** -- no data collection, no analytics, no network requests
- **A complete toolset** -- formatting, validation, minification, tree view, and editor in one extension
- **Modern platform** -- built on Manifest V3 for better security and performance
- **Customization** -- themes, indentation options, key sorting, and multi-language support

## When Alternatives Might Be Better

- If you need **JSON Schema validation** or advanced editing workflows, JSON Editor Online offers more power (with a freemium model).
- If you only need **page-level JSON rendering** and want the simplest possible tool, JSON Viewer or JSONView may be sufficient.
- If you work in a **corporate environment** that restricts extension installation, a web-based tool like JSON Editor Online (the website, not the extension) may be more accessible.
