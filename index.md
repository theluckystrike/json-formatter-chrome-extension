# JSON Formatter Pro

**A developer's best friend for working with JSON.** Format, validate, and explore JSON directly in your browser -- no need to copy-paste into external tools.

JSON Formatter Pro is a free, open source Chrome extension that automatically detects and formats JSON responses in your browser tabs. Collapsible tree view, syntax highlighting, and raw/formatted toggle make working with APIs effortless.

## Why JSON Formatter Pro?

If you work with REST APIs, webhooks, or any service that returns JSON, you have probably stared at a wall of unformatted text in your browser. JSON Formatter Pro fixes that automatically. Open any URL that returns JSON, and it is instantly formatted with a clean, interactive tree view.

No setup required. No accounts. No data sent anywhere. It all happens locally in your browser.

## Built for Developers

JSON Formatter Pro is designed with the developer workflow in mind:

- **API development** -- Inspect API responses directly in the browser without switching to Postman or curl

- **Code reviews** -- Verify JSON payloads and configuration files in browser-based tools
- **Learning** -- Explore public APIs with a clear, readable view of the data they return

## Privacy and Security

JSON Formatter Pro processes everything locally in your browser. It does not:

- Send your JSON data to any server
- Track which URLs you visit
- Collect analytics or usage data
- Require network access of any kind

The source code is fully available on [GitHub](https://github.com/theluckystrike/json-formatter-chrome-extension) for review and contributions.

5. **Copy** any part of the JSON tree to your clipboard

That is it. No configuration needed.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does JSON Formatter Pro work on local files?
Yes. You can enable the "Allow access to file URLs" option in Chrome's extension settings to format local `.json` files.

### Will it slow down my browsing?
No. The extension only activates when it detects that a page contains a JSON response. It has zero impact on normal web browsing.

### Can I format JSON that is not auto-detected?
The extension is designed to auto-detect JSON content types. If a server returns JSON with a non-standard content type, the extension may not activate automatically. In those cases, you can use the popup to manually format the page content.

### Is it compatible with other developer tools?
Yes. JSON Formatter Pro works alongside browser DevTools and other extensions without conflicts. It formats JSON at the page level, so your DevTools network panel and console remain unaffected.

### Does it support JSONP or JSON with comments?
The extension focuses on standard JSON. JSONP responses and JSON with comments (JSONC) may not be auto-detected, but standard JSON from APIs and data endpoints is fully supported.
